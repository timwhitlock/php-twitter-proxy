# Twitter API Proxy 

This is the proxy code used by [Flamingo](http://twproxy.eu).

The `1.1` directory contains the endpoints exposed by the proxy. 
Add and edit these as you need, being careful not to expose private data.

Copy `config-sample.php` to `config.php` to get started.

Point your browser at: `http://your-host/your-root/1.1/account/verify_credentials.php?skip_status=1&callback=jsfunc` to test.
